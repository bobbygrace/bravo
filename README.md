![Bravo, you!](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/379970/bravo.png)

Gives bravos, little pictorial congratulations, to friends via HTML.

Use “to”, “msg”, and “from” URI query strings, like… 

`index.html?to=@person&msg=Way%20to%20go!&from=@me`

Drop the “from” to send it from… “a secret admirer <3”! :O
