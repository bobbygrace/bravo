![Bravo, you!](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/379970/bravo.png)

Gives bravos, little pictorial congratulations, via URLs.

To get up and running:

- `npm install`
- `coffee app.coffee`

Then use “to”, “msg”, and “from” URI query strings, like… 

`localhost:8080/?to=@person&msg=Way%20to%20go!&from=@me`

Drop the “from” to send it from “a secret admirer <3”! Drop all the fields to send a generic “Bravo! from a secret admirer <3”!

Bravo, you did it! :D
